      <p>
        Hello, my name is Cullen Knott, I am a fullstack web developer with a
        passion to create and I obtained my fullstack programming certification
        from the UCLA Fullstack Bootcamp as traditional schooling just didn't
        work for me. I am currently 22 years-old living in San Diego, CA with
        experience creating front-end and back-end applications.
