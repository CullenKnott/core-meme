          Hello, my name is Cullen Knott, I am a fullstack web developer with a
          passion to create and I obtained my fullstack programming
          certification from the UCLA Fullstack Bootcamp as traditional
          schooling just didn't work for me. I am currently 22 years-old living
          in San Diego, CA with experience creating front-end and back-end
          applications.
